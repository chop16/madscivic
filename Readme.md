# x10 Civic Mod - Todo List

Below is an unverified list of current progress on civics.

## General Principles
- For a lot of the flat bonuses we can just multiply by 10, so that is straightforward
- We should try not to concern ourselves too much with balance, the civics are supposed to be broken
  - That said, if a x10 bonus on one of the negative parts of a civic would make the civic worse than the base game version, just leave it as is instead
- A few considerations for some complications that come up with jobs and buildings
  - If a civic provides a unique job and a unique building/holding that produces those unique jobs (e.g. rangers lodge), consider only modifying the number of jobs provided, not the job output, in order to avoid multiplying the affect twice
  - If the job is an upgraded version of another job (e.g. angler from farmer, pearl diver from artisan, death chronicler from culture worker), then only multiply the difference between the two jobs by 10
    - This may cause some strange edge cases, such as the pearl diver having -3 consumer goods production. Consider these on a case by case basis.
